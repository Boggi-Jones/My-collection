31. 8. 2021 - 14:45-15:15

Write everything in English

Remember to update into GitLab if you prefer docs

Setup priorities for User Stories

Need to write more scenarios

We use version 2 of what we made originally

03. 09. 2021 - 09:00-12:00

Finished making priorities for User Stories

Decided the pharmacist would have their own site so that the only thing we would send is a prescription.

Decided to keep them in as C priority to ask our stakeholder if we needed to implement the pharmacy.

Decided to split doctors as stakeholders into Drop in doctors, Appointment doctors and Surgeons. Since we have three different sectors of the hospital

Added patients as a stakeholder, don't interact with the system but heavily rely on it.

Tuesdays and Fridays we can work in M201
