# Tue 21 Sep 14:45 - 15:00 zoom meeting
## Sprint 2 retrospect
The cooperation, selecting user stories and general problem solving went well. However some minor organisation problems that could easily been avoided if we would have taken a little bit more of a time before going to code to setup up how we are going to structure the program and agreed on a way of running the scripts.

# Fri 24 sep 9:00-12:00 meeting at HR
In sprint 2 we did not manage to finish create doctor function, and add endpoints for appointment functions.
In this meeting we decided the definition of done for sprint 3, added new user stories to the product catalogue for sprint 3 and divided the user stories to smaller tasks and assigned to team members. We decide that in sprint 3 we would finish implementing: view, add, remove, update for Doctors, patients and nurses. We are also going to fix the two problems that were not finished in sprint 2.

# Tue 28 Sep 14:45 - 15:00 zoom meeting with Fri√∞rik
Talked about the plan for sprint 3, decided that we needed to move finished tasks for sprint 3 in a new board Sprint 3 Closed. Every thing else was fine.
